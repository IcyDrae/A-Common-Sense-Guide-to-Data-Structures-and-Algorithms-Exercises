1. Imagine you were to take an empty binary search tree and insert the fol-
lowing sequence of numbers in this order: [1, 5, 9, 2, 4, 10, 6, 3, 8].
Draw a diagram showing what the binary search tree would look like.
Remember, the numbers are being inserted in the order presented here.

Answer:

      1
       \
        5
       / \
      2   9
       \  / \
        4 6  10
       /   \
      3     8

2. If a well-balanced binary search tree contains 1,000 values, what is the
maximum number of steps it would take to search for a value within it?

Answer: The maximum number of steps it would take to search for a value
within it would be log2(1000) which is around 10(9,97), which is the
time complexity for searching a well-balanced binary search tree.
