1. If you were writing software for a call center that places callers on hold
and then assigns them to “the next available representative,” would you
use a stack or a queue?

Answer: I would use a Queue because Queues use the order of First In First Out,
which makes sure that the person who's been waiting the longest gets
served first.

2. If you pushed numbers onto a stack in the following order: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
and then popped two items, which number would you be able to read
from the stack?

Answer: I would be able to read the number 4.

3. If you inserted numbers into a queue in the following order: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
and then dequeued two items, which number would you be able to read
from the queue?

Answer: I would be able to read the number 3.
