3. Imagine youâ€™ve built a brand-new heap by inserting the following numbers
into the heap in this particular order: 55, 22, 34, 10, 2, 99, 68. If you
then pop them from the heap one at a time and insert the numbers into
a new array, in what order would the numbers now appear?

Answer: [99, 68, 55, 34, 22, 10, 2] because when we pop the elements
the largest comes first, then the next largest and so on.
