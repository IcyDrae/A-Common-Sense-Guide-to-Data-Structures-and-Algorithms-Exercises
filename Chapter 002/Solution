1. How many steps would it take to perform a linear search for the number
8 in the ordered array, [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13]?
Answer: It would take 4 steps to locate 8. Searching from the beginning
and going number by number, first 2, then 4, then 6, then 8 and returning
the value.

2. How many steps would binary search take for the previous example?
Answer: Binary search would take one step for the previous example. Locating it
right in the middle as the first step. 8 is the middlesmost element.

3. What is the maximum number of steps it would take to perform a binary
search on an array of size 100,000?
We need to repeatedly divide 100,000 by 2 until we get to a number near enough
of zero. This yields us 16, which means binary search will take 16 steps
in an array of size 100,000.
